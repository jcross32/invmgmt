Task: Create a simple inventory management system. The system should be able to handle basic operations for managing product inventory for a small store. The tasks should include adding new products, updating existing product information, calculating inventory values, and displaying all products in the inventory.

Requirements:

    Product:
        Each product should have an ID, a name, a quantity in stock, and a price per unit.
        Implement methods to update the product's quantity and price.

    Inventory:
        Maintain a list of all products in the inventory.
        Implement methods to:
            Add a new product.
            Remove a product by ID.
            Update the quantity of a product.
            Calculate the total value of the inventory (total price * quantity).
            List all products in the inventory.

    Testing:
        Write a simple main function or test script to demonstrate:
            Adding a few products to the inventory.
            Updating product details.
            Removing a product.
            Displaying the inventory list and total inventory value.
